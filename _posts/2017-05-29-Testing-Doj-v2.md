-   Pushing some pics of the [devkit
    2.0](/include/devkit2.0/20170529_203924_notes.jpg) - note that this
    config allows pulse transmit. Pulse from the pulser, receiving
    through the analog front end.. and acquisition managed by the adc
    and raspberry.
-   Note to self: this config requires a "good" usb power supply. It
    succeded with a 5V 750mA power supply - but failed from USB.
-   @done Add a documentation server
-   @done Display IP on the OLED.

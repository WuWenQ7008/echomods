-   lit3 received, doesn't burn. yet. icoprog can flash the flash. but
    fpga won't boot from it.
-   Connections seem OK
-   icebreaker-sch.pdf says the connections are fine
-   possibly need to make clean icoprog
-   or to swap IOs for programming, while
-   beware, for flash programming, SPI\_SS needs to be kept floating
    high. Floating.
-   @done keep an eye on "BRUEL KJAER ULTRASOUND" =)

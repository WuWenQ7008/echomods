-   first a-law experiment :
    https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/experiments/auto/20200421b.md
-   worked on comparing both boards:
    https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/experiments/auto/20200421a.md
    -- need a full fledge mini before moving forward with the
    comparison.
-   [verilog alaw
    compression](https://github.com/kelu124/vit3rick/tree/master/MSB_1_Enveloppe)
    is ok and [simuls on icarus
    OK](https://github.com/kelu124/vit3rick/tree/master/MSB_2_alaw/code_alaw/sim/icarus)
    too.
-   Idea for i2s update on rpi :
    https://github.com/ryankurte/rpi-i2s-stereo/blob/master/instructions.md
-   @done check newer lit3rick.vF
-   @done merge bgd/and (acq + i2s + transfo)
-   @cancelled go onto yosys (not possible from a up5k perspective.. too
    tight on timings)
-   @done understand echoes from acqs.. weird things
-   @done consider additional CS (

Article: Impressive [Development of a Low-Cost Medical Ultrasound
Scanner Using a Monostatic Synthetic
Aperture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7982705/)

I'm a noob at this, but it seems that MFFS uses fixed focus piezos, but
MSAS does focusing in the software (hence synthetic aperture) using a
piezo of known size. That's an interesting alternative to focused
piezos.

Some other interesting insights, like using "Quality Assurance for
UltraSound (QA4US) software" for image quality assessment, or also the
architecture they used (an ARM, 14-bit ADC at 12Msps), or even the fact
that the piezo is in direct contact with the skin, or a motor using a
Voice Coil Motor.

@done add the MSAS principles to the un0rick article
